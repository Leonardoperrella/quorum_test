# 1. Discuss your strategy and decisions implementing the application. Please, consider time complexity, effort cost, technologies used and any other variable that you understand important on your development process.

- I used the jupter notebook to do some tests and remember the pandas library.
- I created 1 test for each question and implemented the solution.
- I would still need to refactor the services as they have practically identical functions

# 2. How would you change your solution to account for future columns that might be requested, such as “Bill Voted On Date” or “Co-Sponsors”?

    - Decouple dependencies from functions in services.

# 3. How would you change your solution if instead of receiving CSVs of data, you were given a list of legislators or bills that you should generate a CSV for?

    - Adapt the load functions (load_bills, load_legislators)

# 4. How long did you spend working on the assignment?

    - 6 hours
